<h2 align="center">:vulcan_salute: Hi, I'm scheatkode</h2>

Welcome to  my digital  garden, a  clusterfuck of  thoughts and  notes with
varying degrees of  bakedness and absurdity. Think  of it as a  vault of my
ongoing  note  taking. The  topics  are  broad  and mostly  cover  computer
science, systems  and network administration,  and whatever rabbit  holes I
may stumble upon, whenever I have the time to put them into words, that is.

I believe making these notes public may help some other misguided fella out
of an ordeal of their own and hence here we are.

I may generate a static website out  of these notes at some point, not sure
when though.

You're free to correct me if you stumble upon anything wrong or outdated.
