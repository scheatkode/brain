<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>210</td><td>Some physical memory locations on persistent memory disk %1 are corrupt.

<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>212</td><td>One of the NVDIMMs that make up the persistent memory disk %1 is in a degraded health state and may soon encounter serious problems. Consider backing up your data to another disk.                    
                    
Look at the events logged by the physical NVDIMM driver for more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>213</td><td>The physical devices that make up persistent memory disk %1 have an atomicity setting that is incompatible with the data on the disk. Windows didn&#39;t start the disk to prevent data loss.             
             
This type of problem can happen when you update your computer&#39;s firmware, or when you upgrade from a version of Windows that doesn&#39;t look at atomicity settings to one that does.             
             
To recover the disk, follow these steps:             
1. Open the registry editor (regedit) and navigate to &#39;Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\ACPI\ACPI0012\&lt;instance ID&gt;\Device Parameters&#39;. There will only be one instance ID key.             
2. Create a registry key named &#39;ScmBus&#39;. Inside it, create a new DWORD value named &#39;IgnoreLabels&#39; and set it to 1.             
3. Restart your computer.             
4. When Windows starts again, your persistent memory disks will be accessible. Back up **all the data** on **all of them** to a different disk. NOTE: these recovery steps will clear all persistent memory disks, even the ones that aren&#39;t affected by this problem, so it&#39;s important to back up all your data.             
5. Open the registry editor, navigate to the &#39;IgnoreLabels&#39; value you created and set it to 0.             
6. Restart your computer.             
7. The persistent memory disk will be inaccessible again. To use it, you will have to reinitialize all physical persistent memory devices on the system. Open an elevated PowerShell window and run &#39;Get-PmemPhysicalDevice | Initialize-PmemPhysicalDevice&#39;.             
8. The last step is to recreate the persistent memory disks. You can do that in the elevated PowerShell window by running &#39;Get-PmemUnusedRegion | New-PmemDisk&#39;. Look at the help content for &#39;New-PmemDisk&#39; to learn how to specify the disks&#39; atomicity modes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>214</td><td>The persistent memory disk %1 is inaccessible because at least one of its NVDIMMs are locked. Contact your hardware vendor for instructions on how to unlock the NVDIMMs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>215</td><td>The driver for persistent memory disk %1 encountered an internal error. The information in the Details tab might help Microsoft or your platform vendor to diagnose the problem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>300</td><td>Persistent memory disk %1 is now in read-only mode.  Use the Get-PhysicalDisk command to get the deviceâ€™s health status.  The Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk/Operational event log may also contain more information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>301</td><td>Persistent memory disk %1 is no longer in read-only mode.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-PersistentMemory-PmemDisk</td><td>302</td><td>Windows does not support this configuration: two or more NVDIMMs on this system are part of an interleaved set. Back up the data on the interleaved set to a different drive and then break up the interleaved set. Consider using Storage Spaces if NVDIMM capacity needs to be aggregated.</td></tr>
