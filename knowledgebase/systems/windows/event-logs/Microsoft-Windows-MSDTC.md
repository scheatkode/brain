This means that the two MS DTC will not be able to communicate with each other. This problem typically occurs if one of the systems were cloned using unsupported cloning tools. MS DTC requires that the systems be cloned using supported cloning tools such as SYSPREP. Running &#39;msdtc -uninstall&#39; and then &#39;msdtc -install&#39; from the command prompt will fix the problem. Note: Running &#39;msdtc -uninstall&#39; will result in the system losing all MS DTC configuration information.</td></tr>
