<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service</td><td>131</td><td>The DNS server failed to initialize NetBIOS lookups to support WINSR for reverse lookup zones.  The server will continue to run but will not attempt to perform WINS reverse lookups.  This may be due to an incorrect configuration.  If WINSR lookups are not required, remove WINSR records from zone data files and reload modified zones or restart the DNS server.  If the DNS server should support WINSR reverse lookup, restart the server computer and verify that the WINS/NetBT configuration for TCP/IP client properties on the computer are correctly set.</td></tr>

Verify that this is a valid IP address for the server computer.  If it is NOT valid use the Interfaces dialog under Server Properties in the DNS Manager to remove it from the list of IP interfaces.  Then stop and restart the DNS server. (If this was the only IP interface on this machine and the DNS server may not have started as a result of this error.  In that case remove the DNS\Parameters\ ListenAddress value in the services section of the registry and restart.) 
 
If this is a valid IP address for this machine, make sure that no other application (e.g. another DNS server) is running that would attempt to use the DNS port.

<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service</td><td>409</td><td>The DNS server list of restricted interfaces contains IP addresses that are not configured for use at the server computer. 
 
Use the DNS manager server properties, interfaces dialog, to verify and reset the IP addresses the DNS server should listen on.  For more information, see &quot;To restrict a DNS server to listen only on selected addresses&quot; in the online Help.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service</td><td>410</td><td>The DNS server list of restricted interfaces does not contain a valid IP address for the server computer. The DNS server will use all IP interfaces on the machine.

<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service</td><td>411</td><td>The DNS server has bound one or more socket pool sockets to port numbers from port exclusion range %1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service</td><td>414</td><td>The DNS server computer currently does not have a DNS domain name.  Its DNS name is a single-label host name with no domain (for example:  &quot;host&quot; rather than &quot;host.microsoft.com&quot;). 
 
You might have forgotten to configure a primary DNS domain for the server computer. 
 
Because the DNS server has only a single-label name, all zones created will have default records (SOA and NS) created using only this single-label name for the server&#39;s host name.  This can lead to incorrect and failed referrals when clients and other DNS servers use these records to locate this server by name. 
 
To correct this problem: 
  1) Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
  2) Open System and Maintenance , and then open System. 
  3) Click Change Settings, and then click Change.  4) Click either Domain or Workgroup, and then type the name of the domain or  workgroup you want the computer to join; the domain or workgroup name will be used as your DNS domain name. 
  5) When prompted, restart the computer.
 
After the computer restarts, the DNS server will attempt to fix up default records, substituting the new DNS name of this server for the old single-label name.  However, you should review the zone&#39;s SOA and NS records to ensure that they now use the correct domain name of this server.</td></tr>

Check the following areas for possible self-send configuration errors: 
  1) Forwarders list. (DNS servers should not forward to themselves). 
  2) Master lists of secondary zones. 
  3) Notify lists of primary zones. 
  4) Delegations of subzones.  Must not contain NS record for this DNS server unless subzone is also on this server. 
  5) Root hints. 
 
Example of self-delegation: 
  -&gt; This DNS server dns1.example.microsoft.com is the primary for the zone example.microsoft.com. 
  -&gt; The example.microsoft.com zone contains a delegation of bar.example.microsoft.com to dns1.example.microsoft.com, 
  (bar.example.microsoft.com NS dns1.example.microsoft.com) 
  -&gt; BUT the bar.example.microsoft.com zone is NOT on this server. 
 
Note, you should make this delegation check (with nslookup or DNS manager) both on this DNS server and on the server(s) you delegated the subzone to. It is possible that the delegation was done correctly, but that the primary DNS for the subzone, has any incorrect NS record pointing back at this server. If this incorrect NS record is cached at this server, then the self-send could result.  If found, the subzone DNS server admin should remove the offending NS record. 
 
You can use the DNS server debug logging facility to track down the cause of this problem.</td></tr>
