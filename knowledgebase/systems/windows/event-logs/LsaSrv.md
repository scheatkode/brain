This event is generated when a new logon session is created and the user token associated with it contains user and/or device claims. The New Logon fields indicate the account that was logged on. If all the user and device claims in the user token cannot be accommodated in a single event, multiple such events are generated. The Event in sequence field indicates how many more events are generated for this logon session. Each user or device claim is represented in the following format:

	ClaimID ClaimTypeID : Value1, Value2 â€¦ 

The common claim types are: 0 (Invalid Type), 1 (64-bit Integer, 2 (Unsigned 64-bit Integer), 3 (String), 4 (FQBN), 5 (SID), 6 (Boolean) and 16 (Blob). If the claim value exceeds the max allowed length then the string is terminated by ...</td></tr>
