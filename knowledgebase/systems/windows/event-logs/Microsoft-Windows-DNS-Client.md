The cause of this DNS registration failure was because of DNS server failure. This may be due to a zone transfer that has locked the DNS server for the applicable zone that your computer needs to register itself with.

(The applicable zone should typically correspond to the Adapter-specific Domain Suffix that was indicated above.)

The system could not register the DNS update request because of a security related problem. This could happen for the following reasons: (a) the DNS domain name that your computer is trying to register could not be updated because your computer does not have the right permissions, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server to update.

The cause was DNS server failure. This may be because the reverse lookup zone is busy or missing on the DNS server that your computer needs to update. In most cases, this is a minor problem because it does not affect normal (forward) name resolution.

If reverse (address-to-name) resolution is required for your computer, you can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing &#39;ipconfig /registerdns&#39; at the command prompt.
