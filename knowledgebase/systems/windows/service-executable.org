By default, you  cannot directly change the path to  executable in the Windows
service program.  The following steps are  required to make any  change to the
services. No  restart is necessary but  a service restart is  required to take
account of the changes made.

There are two methods of doing so.

* Method 1

  Using the *Registry Editor*, browse to the following directory.

  #+begin_quote
HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<your-service>
  #+end_quote

  There,  you  will  find  everything  related to  the  queried  service.  The
  executable path key is named =ImagePath=.

* Method 2

  Using the *Command Prompt*, enter the following command.

  #+begin_src bat
SC CONFIG your-service binPath= "executable-path"
  #+end_src

  And that's it.
