Stupidity  lurks at  every  corner and,  for a  tired  and overworked  systems
administrator, happens to  be closer than usual, especially when  backing up a
disk that happens to have a corrupt hybrid MBR/GPT partitioning scheme.

* Recommendations

  - *It is HIGHLY recommended to perform a backup of the data !*
  - Keep  this guide  handy since  *you will  have to  make operations  without
    Windows working or access to a web browser*.

* Instructions

  1. Create a [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-a-recovery-drive-abb4691b-5324-6d4a-8766-73fab304c246][system recovery drive]] or some other WinPE-based recovery utility
     if your  Windows is unbootable.  /Tried and working with  [[https://sergeistrelec.ru][Sergei Strelec's
     WinPE]]/.
  2. Boot using your Windows installation or previously generated system
     recovery drive.
  3. Choose your preferred language and select /Repair Your Computer →
     Troubleshoot → Advanced options → Command Prompt/.
  4. We will need the disk partitioning tool to recreate the boot partitions.
     In the command prompt, type =diskpart=.

  #+begin_src bat
C:\> diskpart DISKPART>
  #+end_src

  5. Identify the disk in which your Windows installation is located by typing
     =list disk=. You should see a table like the one below :

  #+begin_src bat
DISKPART> list disk

  Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt

  --------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---

* Disk 0    Online          512 GB      0 B        *
  #+end_src

  6. Once identified, select the disk by typing =select disk <your identified
     disk number here>=.

  #+begin_src bat
DISKPART> select disk 0

Disk 0 is now the selected disk.

DISKPART>
  #+end_src

  7. Verify the partitions with =list partition=.

  #+begin_src bat
DISKPART> list partition

  Partition ###  Type              Size     Offset

  -------------  ----------------  -------  -------

  Partition 1    Primary            350 MB  1024 KB

  Partition 2    Primary            126 GB   350 MB

DISKPART>
  #+end_src

  8. Delete the previous system partition :

  #+begin_src bat
DISKPART> select partition 1

Partition 1 is now the selected partition.

DISKPART> delete partition
  #+end_src

  9. Create the new boot partition and Microsof reserved partition:

  #+begin_src bat
DISKPART> create partition EFI size=100 offset=1

...

DISKPART> format quick fs=fat32 label="System"

...

DISKPART> assign letter=S

...

DISKPART> create partition msr size=128 offset=103424

...

DISKPART>
  #+end_src

  1. Ensure that your Windows installation is mounted, replacing =3= with the
     volume number of your Windows installation:

  #+begin_src bat
DISKPART> list volume

...

DISKPART> select volume 3

...

DISKPART> assign letter=C

...

DISKPART>
  #+end_src

  11. Exit diskpart:

  #+begin_src bat
DISKPART> exit
C:\>
  #+end_src

  1. Generate boot partition data, replacing C: with the letter of your
     Windows installation:

  #+begin_src bat
C:\> bcboot C:\Windows /s S: /f UEFI
  #+end_src

  13. Cross your fingers and restart the computer.

  #+begin_src bat
C:\> shutdown /r /t 0
  #+end_src

   Good luck !
