Either for  penetration testing or  simply password  leak auditing, it  can be
useful to  extract the =ntds.dit=  file, containing the entire  active directory
database as well as user password hashes.

* ntdsutil

  When there  is access to  the Domain Controller,  it's possible to  dump the
  =ntds.dit=  file using  the =ntdsutil.exe=  utility. This  solution is  the most
  robust.

  #+begin_src bat
NTDSUTIL.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full C:\TEMP' q q
  #+end_src

  The utility  dumps the  requested =ntds.dit=  file as well  as the  =SYSTEM= and
  =SECURITY= registry hives to the mentioned path.
