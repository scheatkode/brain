Salt  is a  software  to  automate the  management  and  configuration of  any
infrastructure or application at scale.

Built  on python,  Salt  uses  simple and  human-readable  YAML combined  with
event-driven  automation  to  deploy  and configure  complex  IT  systems.  In
addition  to leveling-up  vRealize Automation  SaltStack Config,  Salt can  be
found under  the hood  of products from  Juniper, Cisco,  Cloudflare, Nutanix,
SUSE, and Tieto, to name a few.
