When using  Windows 10, 450MB Recovery  partition usually gets created  in the
tail end of the disk. This is all  good and dandy, except when there is a need
to extend  the system partition. This  can be tricky since  the aforementioned
recovery partition gets in the way.

When  dealing  with  this  predicament,  there  are  a  few  possibilities  to
consider :

1. Moving the partition (recommended)
2. Removing the partition
3. Converting the disk to dynamic

* Moving the partition

  According  to  [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/capture-and-apply-windows-system-and-recovery-partitions][Microsoft's  documentation]],  the recovery  partition  can  be
  captured and applied elsewhere.

  1. Use =dispart= to find current recovery partition and assign a driver letter
     (eg. =O=) to it:

     #+begin_src bat
     DISKPART> list disk
     DISKPART> select disk <number-of-disk>
     DISKPART> list partition
     DISKPART> select partition <number-of-partition>
     DISKPART> assign letter=O
     #+end_src

  2. Create an image file from current recovery partition :

     #+begin_src bat
     DISM                                    ^
        /Capture-Image                       ^
        /ImageFile:C:\recovery-partition.wim ^
        /CaptureDir:O:\                      ^
        /Name:"Recovery"
     #+end_src

  3. (Optional) Delete the old recovery partition :

     #+begin_src bat
     DISKPART> select volume O DISKPART> delete partition override
     #+end_src

  4. Apply the created image to another partition (eg. =N=) that will become the
     new  recovery partition.  That  is,  after you  have  made the  necessary
     moving, resizing and recreating. The recommended way is to create a 500MB
     partition /before/ the  system one; use whatever tools you  see fit at this
     point, a live =gparted= works wonders in this case.

     #+begin_src bat
     DISM                                    ^
        /Apply-Image                         ^
        /ImageFile:C:\recovery-partition.wim ^
        /Index:1                             ^
        /ApplyDir:N:\
     #+end_src

  5. Register the location of the recovery tools :

     #+begin_src bat
     Reagentc /Disable
     Reagentc /SetReImage /Path N:\Recovery\WindowsRE
     Reagentc /Enable
     #+end_src

  6. Use =diskpart= to hide the recovery partition :

     - For =UEFI= :

        #+begin_src bat
        DISKPART> select volume N
        DISKPART> set id="de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6ac"
        DISKPART> gpt attributes=0x8000000000000001
        DISKPART> remove
        #+end_src

     - For =BIOS= :

        #+begin_src bat
        DISKPART> select volume N
        DISKPART> set id=27
        DISKPART> remove
        #+end_src

  7. Reboot the computer for the new recovery partition to take effect.

  8. (Optional) Further checks for the recovery partition :

     a. Show the current status :

        #+begin_src bat
        Reagentc /Info
        #+end_src

     b. Specifies that Windows RE should start automatically the next time the
        system starts :

        #+begin_src bat
        Reagentc /BootToRe
        #+end_src

     c. Reboot the computer and do your thing in Windows RE (eg. enter =cmd= and
        run some tools)

* Removing the partition

  Deleting the partition  completely should cause no problem  since Windows 10
  already has  built-in refresh features  to do a  factory reset. But  as with
  everything  Microsoft-related, you're  never  sure; hence  why  this is  not
  recommended.

* Converting the disk to dynamic

  It is possible  to create a partition that spans  across various spaces with
  [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/basic-and-dynamic-disks][dynamic disk]], which is  the analog of Linux's LVM. Just  convert the disk to
  dynamic and extend the partition to any available space.
